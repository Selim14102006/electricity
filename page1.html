        <h2>What is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity">electricity</a>? And what are its types?</h2>
        <b>Electricity is the flow of electric charge, typically through a conductor such as a wire. It is a form of energy resulting from the existence of charged particles like electrons or protons.</b> <h4>
There are mainly two types of electricity:
</h4><br><br><ul><li>
<span class="span">Static Electricity</span>: The accumulation of electric charge on the surface of objects.
</li><li>
<span class="span">Current Electricity</span>: The flow of electric charge through a conductor.</li></ul>
<br><br></section><section class="section1">

  <h2>What are the forms of electricity?</h2>
  <h4>The forms of electricity include:</h6>
  <ul>
  <li><span class="span">Direct Current (DC)</span>: The electric charge flows in one constant direction. </li> 
  
  <li><span class="span">Alternating Current (AC)</span>: The electric charge changes direction periodically.
Other specialized forms include pulsed electricity, static electricity, and electromagnetic waves.

  </ul>
